# Phoenix WinNonLin 과 결과 비교 {#wnl-comparison}

## Conclusion 

*There is no discrepancy* between results from NonCompart and WinNonlin. We also performed multiple analyses with the real clinical trial datasets and have found no differences (data not shown: confidential).  Noncompartmental analysis performed by the open-source R package, NonCompart can be **qualified and validated** enough to acquire the identical results of the commercial software, WinNonlin.

*Please report issues regarding validation of the R package to <https://github.com/asancpt/NonCompart-tests/issues>.*
